# engineering-portfolio
this is my (unfinished) portfolio project
you should use this because it's a cool thing
I stole the banana idea from https://www.danielspatzek.com/home/, and also the fonts
I also stole the cursor thing from myself and I have no idea where I found that banana model, actually I think it's from: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/fruit-food-banana-3d-1610134

things to  implement:
- ~~banana flys across the screen~~
- Infinite scrolling
- particles
- Cool mouse effect
- Add embeddings of previous projects with an arrow maybe?
- Try cool effects? idk
- Thing that says if you right click for context menu


# THIS IS OUTDATED
