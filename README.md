# intro-portfolio_kai
this is my (unfinished) portfolio project)
you should use this because it's a cool thing
I stole the banana idea from https://www.danielspatzek.com/home/, and also the fonts

things to  implement:
- banana flys across the screen
- Infinite scrolling
- particles
- Cool mouse effect
- Add embeddings of previous projects with an arrow maybe?
- Try cool effects? idk
