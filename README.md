# Kai Stewart – Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal engineering-portfolio website.  
It is intentionally lightweight: just static HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, so it can be deployed to any basic file host (e.g. GitHub Pages, like I'm using)

## Highlights

• **3-D Banana** – model, materials and small Three.js scene authored by me.  It lazily loads to keep the initial page weight low.
• **Scroll-triggered reveal animations** and a custom cursor follower I designed some years back.
• **Project pages** generated from Markdown + CSV image manifests so new projects can be added without touching HTML.

## Credits

Almost all code and the banana model are my own work.  Icons are provided by [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) under the MIT License.  Webfonts served via Google Fonts.
