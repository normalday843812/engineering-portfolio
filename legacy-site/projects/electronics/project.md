## Learning Objectives
For this project, I first had to learn the principles of electronic circuits, such as Ohm's Law (V=IR). I then was able to solder various components including resistors, capacitors, transistors, battery wires, a switch, and LEDs to a PCB and troubleshoot it until it worked.

## Reflection
I was able to learn and comprehend more about how electronic circuits worked and how to apply it to actual devices. There was a little hiccup with the first board I soldered having a defective component, but I was able to quickly fix it.
