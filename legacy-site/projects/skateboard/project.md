# Skateboard
For this project, I designed and fabricated a skateboard.
## Design Process
I used a variety of tools to help us in this task. In order to research the various designs and dimensions for a skateboard, I had to use Google until I was able to understand what each dimensional parameter did. For the designing step, I used a combination of OnShape (CAD) and [sk8cad](sk8cad.com).<br>
First, I inputted my chosen parameters into sk8cad, which gave me a 3d model of the skateboard and the mold to form the skateboard. I used OnShape to import the skateboard and project the top view shape onto a sketch. This sketch allowed me to cut out a flat board in the right dimensions using a water jet. For the mold, I was able to use ASPIRE/VECTRIC CNC routing software to import the 3d model and design tool paths that would cut the mold out. It was simple to make the toolpaths using first a rough cut then a finer cut for the mold. Once I was finished cutting three outlines with the waterjet, I glued them together to make the board more substantial. I was then able to use a vacuum pump to form the board to the mold, creating these bends like a real skateboard. Others doing this project were allowed to use paint. To finish, I sanded down the rough parts of the board and added the actual wheels and trucks to the board with grip tape on the top.
This was similar to reverse engineering, where I had to take skateboards, and figure out how to design them myself.
