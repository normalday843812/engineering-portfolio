# Ping Pong Paddle

## Designing and Cutting
For the ping pong paddle, I started off by designing a basic shape in Onshape for the paddle. I exported this to Adobe Illustrator, then modified it to be able to laser cut the design with an engraving.

## The Handle
I cut and designed a wooden handle to add more substance to be able to hold it more comfortably.

### Measuring and Cutting
I measured our paddles and cut out two pieces of wood with a miter saw. I glued these wooden parts onto the handle to add thickness. Once the glue had dried, I cut dowels and put holes into the handle with a drill and a benchtop drill press and hammered the dowels in, then cut off the excess. I used a bandsaw to cut out the outline of the paddle and then sand paper to smooth it out.

## Tournament
I used our ping pong paddles to play a ping pong tournament. I didn't place well, but my paddle worked well. I would have made the handle larger if I were to improve it in the future.
