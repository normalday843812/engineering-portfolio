# Isolated Isles
I worked with a group to develop a game named Isolated Isles designed to promote awareness regarding Hawaii's precarious situation of reliance on the mainland for resources. We won for our congressional district and were able to visit Washington D.C. where we networked, learned more about AI's impact on the industry, met our senator, Brian Schatz, and found more current ideas.
## Contributions
I coded most of the core aspects of the game in collaboration with my teammates who helped significanlty to debug and code some additional features. I programmed in C# in Unity and used the built in version control to work with my team. Connor McCown and Josh Zhang would provide the assets through Google Drive, with Josh helping to implement some of them, and then it was integrated into the actual app.
