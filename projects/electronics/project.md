# Electrical Circuits

## Learning Objectives
For this project, I first had to learn the principles of electronic circuits, such as Ohm's Law (V=IR) and circuits in series vs. parallel. I also had to learn how to solder properly and troubleshoot PCBs that didn't work.

## Circuits


### Blinking LED

I was able to solder various components including resistors, capacitors, transistors, battery wires, a switch, and LEDs to a PCB and troubleshoot it until it worked.

### Motor Speed Controller

I got a motor speed controller to work and be able to be controlled via a potentiometer.

## Reflection
I was able to learn and comprehend more about how electronic circuits worked and how to apply it to actual devices. I feel like I was also able to significantly improve my skills in troubleshooting. For the second circuit we made, nobody's motor worked at all. I was able to figure out, using a multimeter and online datasheets for the MOSFET, that the MOSFET required around 10V input to be able to work. We were using a pack of two AA batteries. Based on this, I soldered a 9V battery leads to the PCB and attached the battery. It was able to work and I was very proud of being able to fix it.
