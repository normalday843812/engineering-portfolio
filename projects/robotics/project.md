## Designing
First, we measured our original Punahou IDs. We inserted these measurements into a CAD program (Onshape). We added filets onto the edges to smooth it out, then imported the sketch into Adobe Illustrator for laser cutting the wood. I also added a design of myself with a hand drawn image, my ID card number, "KRLL", "YELLOW", an image of a plane, and my ID card's barcode.

# Sustainability practices
The wood we used was primarily sourced from Home Depot and City Mill.
