# Phone Case

## Empathy

1. What is PLA?
    - PLA (polylactic acid) is a thermoplastic, or a material that becomes plastic when heated and hardens while cooling. It is used in our 3d printers and is bio-based and biodegradable.

2. How is it made?
    - Generally, the manufacture of PLA involves deriving and polymerizing lactic acid from sugars found in plants

3. How is it more sustainable than petroleum based plastic? 
    - As mentioned previously, PLA is bio-based and biodegradable, meaning that it has far less overall impact on the environment than petroleum based plastic

4. What are the constraints your phone case needs to overcome? What is it's purpose?
    - The biggest constraint I had was the attempt to design this phone case to be just as usable as any other while also using PLA. It is designed to be more sustainable while still protecting the phone.

## Define

I made a technical drawing of the phone that I could use to CAD and design the phone case around. You can see the image attached below.

## Ideate

I found out that Apple has a document called the [Accessory Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/accessories/Accessory-Design-Guidelines.pdf). I had already done most of the measurements, but I used this to refine them and find apple designed constraints, like the keep-out zone for the speakers or camera.

## Prototype

For prototyping, the first version I made was slightlly too small for the phone. I didn't account for margin of error in the design or the fact that PLA cannot bend as easily when thick (I made the case about 1mm thick) which made it difficult to put the phone in. To fix this, I made the phone longer, made some buttons less thick, and made this outer ring that held the phone in place thinner to allow for an easier fit. This second version was the final one I printed. It was great because of the fit and the general design, despite a few problems with it. The problems were mainly that the keep out zones for the buttons were too small, holding them down, which sometimes activatd a built-in macro type thing that would call emergency services. I made the CAD design for a v3 of the phone, but couldn't print it because of material constraints.

## Test

After using the phone case, I can comfortably say it is a good design. The main problems are like I said above: mainly the inaccessability/holding down of certain buttons. Despite that, it feels good to hold and appears to be protective.
