# Gridfinity

## Learning Objectives
To learn about what GridFinity was and apply it somewhere in the lab to improve efficiency.

## My project
I decided to print a GridFinity style holder for organising FTC batteries. I first watched a video explaining GridFinity and the applications, then watched a tutorial for how to use a tool to design GridFinity boxes. I performed dimensional analysis on the batteries themselves, using specifications online and a caliper to confirm the measurements. I used OnShape to make the boxes and simply added some holes that would fit the dimensions of the batteries. I tried to 3d print the holder overnight, but apparenlty nothing printed.
